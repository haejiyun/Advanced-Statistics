## [R] Rain prediction with Generalized Linear Model & Model Selection Method

Rain prediction at Bale in Switzerland based on past meteorological information. The dataset has 1,180 observations and 46 covariates which are very correlated. The first part of the project is about selecting the relevant covariates and the second part of the project is about creating an efficient binary model.<br/>

## [R] High School Mutation Score Prediction with Bayesian Estimation

Prediction of necessary points in order for a high school teacher to get mutated to other school. The number of points is prediction for each set of 'high school - subject' using baysian regression. A comparison with a frequentist approch is tested in order to check the plausibility of the bayesian model.
