# Advanced Statistics Projects

<br/>
This repository highlights my in-depth exploration of advanced statistical techniques through a diverse range of academic projects. Drawing from my coursework, these projects showcase my proficiency in applying cutting-edge statistical methods to tackle complex real-world problems. From predicting churn with survival model to forecasting rainfall with generalized linear models, each endeavor demonstrates my ability to select appropriate analytical approaches and draw meaningful conclusions. Additionally, the repository includes explorations of non-parametric estimation, dimension reduction techniques like PCA and FCA, time series analysis of coffee bean prices, Bayesian estimation for high school teacher mutation scores, and extreme value theory for daily precipitation.

- **[R] Rain prediction with Generalized Linear Model & Model Selection Method**<br/>
Project : [click here](https://github.com/haejiyun/statistics-big-data/blob/main/Generalized%20Linear%20Model/MLG_haeji_yun.pdf)<br/>
Rain prediction at Bale in Switzerland based on past meteorological information. The dataset has 1,180 observations and 46 covariates which are very correlated. The first part of the project is about selecting the relevant covariates and the second part of the project is about creating an efficient binary model.
<br/>

- **[R] Non Parametric Estimation**<br/>
Project : [click here](https://github.com/haejiyun/statistics-big-data/blob/main/Non%20Parametric%20Estimation/Estimation_non_parametrique.pdf)<br/>
Theoretical application of non parametric model focusing on explanation of its mathematical foundation from kernel estimation to non parametric regression. The emphasis on the choice of the window and the cross-validation.

- **[R] Principal Component Analysis, Factorial Correspondance Analysis, CAH**<br/>
PCA Project : [click here](https://github.com/haejiyun/statistics-big-data/blob/main/Scoring/ACP_haeji_yun.pdf)<br/>
Analysis of daily protein consumption of european countries. The dataset is composed of different proteine source with the protein quantity of 25 countries based on which similarities, differences, and particularities are analysed.<br/>
FCA & AHC Project : [click here](https://github.com/haejiyun/statistics-big-data/blob/main/Scoring/AFC_Classification_haeji_yun.pdf)<br/>
Analysis of 2017 presidential election of France. 14 candidats and the number of votes they received in different departments compose the dataset. The study gives the first insight on the association between the candidates and the departments. The study is then deepen with the clustering method.
<br/>

- **[R] Coffee Bean Price Prediction with Time Series Method**<br/>
Project : [click here](https://github.com/haejiyun/statistics-big-data/blob/main/Time%20Series/time_series_haeji_yun.pdf)<br/>
Application of time series theory on anlysis of kilo coffee price. The analysis is done with graphical method and different time series analysis methods in order to make a prediction of future kilo coffe prices. Differents time series models are compared.
<br/>

- **[R] High School Mutation Score Prediction with Bayesian Estimation**<br/>
Project : [click here](https://github.com/haejiyun/statistics_big_data_dauphine/blob/main/Bayesian%20Statistics/statistique_bayesienne.pdf)<br/>
Prediction of necessary points in order for a high school teacher to get mutated to other school. The number of points is prediction for each set of 'high school - subject' using baysian regression. A comparison with a frequentist approch is tested in order to check the plausibility of the bayesian model.  
<br/>

- **[R] Daily precipitation prediction with Extreme Values Theory**<br/>
Project : [click here](https://github.com/haejiyun/statistics_big_data_dauphine/blob/main/Extreme%20Values/valeurs_extremes_haeji_yun.pdf)<br/>
Extreme values prediction for daily precipitaion at Marseille. An extrapolation on 1000 years is made from a dataset containing observations of 127 years. Different extreme values models are tested in order to find the most relevant one. 
<br/>

- **[Python] Churn Analysis with Survival Model**<br/>
Churn analysis of an online game. Considering 90 days of inactivity as churn, the probability to churn is predicted based on the users' game characteristics such as the level, the race of game character, the zone visited by the character, belonging to a group etc.
